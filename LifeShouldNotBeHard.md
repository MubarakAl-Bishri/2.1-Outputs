# Life Isn’t *Necessarily* Hard

Okay, I'm thinking about life.

In my opinion, life isn’t really hard — or at least, it *shouldn’t* be. I don’t think it’s naturally meant to be hard. A lot of people *think* life is hard, or they’ve been told it is. And yeah, it definitely feels that way sometimes.

I know this might sound stupid to some people, but hear me out. Let's break it down.

I feel like most people see life as hard because there are a lot of chances that you’re going to lose. But then I ask: what is the thing that you're actually losing?

## Lessons Disguised as Failure

I personally believe life is full of lessons. And yeah, lessons can feel tough — because you don’t have the knowledge or experience to pass through them easily. But maybe that’s the point.

Maybe you *need* these hard lessons so you can get through tougher things in the future.

So when you go through a toxic relationship, or you get a terrible grade in a course — I don’t see that as random failure. I see that as something you *needed* to go through. Like it had to happen. It’s necessary for your growth.

And honestly, I feel like we should be thankful to God when we get those lessons. Because some people never get them — or they only understand them after 80 years and a long list of regrets.

So yeah, to me, a lesson is just an experience that eventually gives you the knowledge you need.

## Mistakes Happen — And That’s the Point

Another thing: I don’t really get why people blame themselves so harshly for mistakes they didn’t know were mistakes at the time.

Personally, I see mistakes as part of the process. You only really blame yourself when you keep repeating the same mistake *after* you’ve already learned it. But even then — how would you even know that repeating a mistake is wrong until you *actually* do it again?

So yeah, that’s another layer to it.

## What Makes a "Loser"?

Let’s talk about the idea of being a loser in life.

To me, there are bare minimums that matter. And I personally believe those come from what God set — like Islam: the five prayers, fasting Ramadan, things like that. That’s the real bare minimum, at least from my point of view.

But anything beyond that? Anything not necessary for survival — like wanting to be rich or famous — is just something you choose to pursue.

So, if someone doesn’t become wealthy, does that make them a loser? I don’t think so. It just means they didn’t achieve *their* personal goal — and that’s okay. Maybe that wasn’t even part of the bigger plan for them.

I’m not saying we have no control in life. But I *do* think that sometimes, even when things don’t go your way, it’s still all part of something good. When you think of life as both a challenge *and* a test, it feels easier to live with.

## The Cost of Raising Your Bare Minimum

Now let’s talk about this: if you change your bare minimum — if you raise your standards — you’re basically signing up for more effort and more time to get what you want.

And that’s okay too. But it comes at a cost.

To explain that properly, I need to talk about my own way of seeing life — something I call the **de facto theory**.

---

## De Facto Theory — Life as Stages of Control

I see life as a bunch of phases or steps. And each phase comes with two types of factors:

- Factors you can control  
- Factors you can’t control

It starts the moment you're born. In that first phase, you control nothing. Everything is in the hands of your parents or the people raising you.

You might think that’s the easiest life — and yeah, maybe. But honestly, life hasn’t even started at that point. That’s just phase zero. And even that can be hard.

---

## Gaining Control, Gaining Problems

As you grow, you get more factors under your control — talking, walking, thinking, choosing how to spend your time.

But at the same time, the *outside* factors grow too. School starts. Rules appear. Expectations rise.

And that’s the thing: the more control you get, the more responsibility — and the more resistance — comes with it. When you were born, you didn’t have to deal with all this. But now, you have to handle things like kindergarten, or social situations, or your future.

So what really changes? Just the number of factors — that’s it.

---

## Everyone’s Life Is Equally Hard — Just in Different Ways

As life goes on, you keep gaining both types of factors. You control more, and life throws more at you. It’s like a balance.

And in my opinion, the only real difference between two people is the **bare minimum they choose**.

If someone decides they want to be great, rich, or famous — they just gave themselves more to deal with. More pressure. More responsibility. More problems.

I personally feel like, at the end of the day, we’re all facing the same level of difficulty — just in different forms. Even when something unexpected happens — like a war breaking out when you're 18 — that’s a horrible shift, but now you might have more time or a different kind of opportunity. Is it hard? Yeah. But so is university. It’s just a different type of effort.

---

## Perfection Isn’t the Point

And here’s where this all clicks for me: *nothing is perfect*.

And that’s the key.

Nobody has a perfect setup. Nobody has it easy all the time. Everyone is living with the same level of “hard,” but with totally different sets of factors.

---

## It’s Not Random

And no — I don’t think it’s chaos.

You weren’t born in this time, in this place, to these parents, with this name, for no reason.

I believe there’s a system. I believe God set something in motion — a system behind the scenes.

But does that mean God is controlling your every step? I don’t think so.

I see it like this: it’s a path in a desert. You’re free to leave it if you want. But why would you? It’s the perfect path. The one that God already knows you’ll choose. The one that’s actually best for you.

---

## Some Lives Hurt — But They Still Matter

Now I’ll be real — I know this theory doesn’t apply to every single life.

There are lives out there that truly hurt. Deeply. Some people go through extreme pain and injustice.

But honestly, I believe those lives matter. They have purpose. They become factors in other lives. They influence, they change things, they shift paths.

Does this mean God gave those lives more pain because He loves them more? Or less?

No.

Because this life — the one we’re living now — isn’t the end result.

And sometimes, it’s necessary to let this life be hard — *in order to win the final game*.

God knows what’s better for you.
